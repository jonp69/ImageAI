🔧 Core Image Processing & Metadata Extraction

    Scan image directories recursively (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp) ✅

    Extract basic image metadata (resolution, format, mode) ✅

    Extract EXIF metadata where available (e.g., camera model, date) ✅

    Parse Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI generation parameters (prompt, seed, sampler, steps, model) ⏳

    Track file path, folder, and tool version in metadata.json ✅

    Track if a file has been moved or deleted ⏳

    Make the metadata schema extensible (resilient to added fields) ✅

📦 Metadata Storage & Normalization

    Save image metadata in centralized JSON file (image_metadata.json) ✅

    Allow modular updating and appending to metadata ✅

    Normalize tag synonyms (e.g., "redhead" → "red_hair") ✅

    Apply tag aliasing to predicted and source tags ✅

    Deduplicate normalized tags ✅

🧠 Tagging & Classification

    Run a local tagger model (e.g., WD14/WDv2) on images ✅

    Set tag inclusion thresholds (confidence score) ✅

    Store all tag confidences ≥ a defined threshold ✅

    Automatically tag images that lack predicted tags ✅

    Handle non-AI-generated images and tag them ✅

    Mark source of predicted tags and tagging version ✅

📋 Tag Comparison & Evaluation

    Compare generated prompt tags vs predicted tags ✅

    Highlight missing or unexpected tags (Jaccard/overlap) ✅

    Compare predicted vs human-assigned tags ✅

    Compute per-image precision, recall, F1 score ✅

    Detect regenerated images (differing only by seed or a few tags) ⏳

🔍 Search & Exploration

    Search images by predicted or prompt tags ✅

    Search for similar images by overlapping tag sets ✅

    Group images by dominant tag, model, or LoRA ⏳

    Filter images by prompt substring or metadata field ⏳

🖼️ Streamlit Dashboard

    View image grid thumbnails with caption ✅

    Show metadata on hover/click or below thumbnail ✅

    Filter by tag, confidence range, or tag category ✅

    Group by tag or LoRA/model ⏳

    Show tag frequency histogram ✅

    Copy/paste positive and negative prompts ✅

    Enable multi-image comparison mode ✅

    Visual tag color-coding based on confidence ✅

📚 Comic Handling

    Detect and split multi-panel comics ✅

    Save panel images with and without text ✅

    Detect text regions via OCR (e.g., Tesseract) ✅

    Mask or remove text (speech bubbles) ✅

    Detect speech bubbles using contour/ellipse detection ✅

📁 CLI + Automation

    CLI version of each module (tagger, normalizer, splitter, etc.) ⏳

    Unified runner script (e.g., tag_all, analyze_all) ⏳

    Set up virtualenv and dependency installer (e.g., setup_venv.bat) ✅

    Store tool version per record for auditability ✅

🧠 Tag Management (Planned / Future)

    Export tag sets or image lists by filter ⏳

    Add/remove tags manually in dashboard ⏳

    Assign tag categories (e.g., hair_color, emotion) ⏳

    Merge and rename tags interactively (via UI or config) ⏳
