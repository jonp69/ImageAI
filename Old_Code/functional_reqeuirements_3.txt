📁 Core Metadata Extraction and Management

    ✅ Parse PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP files for metadata.

    ✅ Recursively scan folders/subfolders where the script is run.

    ✅ Extract from image metadata:

        Folder location

        Prompt (positive/negative)

        Seed

        Resolution

        Steps

        Sampler

        LoRA/Model used

        Encoder

    ✅ Automatically detect and track moved or deleted files.

    ✅ Track which script version generated the JSON entry.

    ✅ Store all data in a persistent JSON database (image_data.json).

    ✅ Modular architecture for CLI and future integration.

🧠 Tagging / AI Model Inference

    ✅ Use an image tagger (e.g., WD-v1.4, John6666 Danbooru Transformer):

        Predict tags with confidence scores.

        Support offline/locally hosted models.

    ✅ Store all tags with confidence above a configurable threshold.

    ✅ Automatically tag any new or untagged image.

    ✅ Tag additional images not generated by diffusion models.

    ✅ Color-code tags by confidence strength.

🔍 Tag Comparison & Accuracy Evaluation

    ✅ Compare:

        Prompt tags (used for generation)

        Predicted tags (from AI model)

        Human-assigned tags (optional)

    ✅ Show differences:

        Missing predictions

        Incorrect predictions

        Common tags

    ✅ Sort images by confidence or tag accuracy.

    ✅ Tag accuracy checker: Model vs. Human tags.

🧠 Tag Search & Exploration Features

    ✅ Danbooru-style tag viewer.

    ✅ Group images by:

        Dominant tag

        Tag category (e.g. character, setting)

        Sampler/LoRA used

    ✅ Search by individual or multiple tags.

    ✅ See co-occurrence of tags used together.

    ✅ Histogram of tag frequencies.

    ✅ Multi-image comparison by prompts or tags.

    ✅ Sort images by:

        Total confidence for a tag

        Number of shared tags

🖼️ Visual Dashboard (Streamlit)

    ✅ Thumbnails with info preview.

    ✅ Toggle thumbnail sizes.

    ✅ Color-coded tag confidence display.

    ✅ Export tags (positive/negative) for use in generation UIs.

    ✅ View tag comparison panel for each image.

🧠 Advanced Logic & Organization

    ✅ Version tagging for each entry.

    ✅ Tag renaming/merging (e.g., red_hair and redhead).

    ✅ Handle regenerated images (same seed or prompt variants).

📚 Comic & Panel Processing (Planned/In Progress)

    🔄 Detect and split multi-panel comics.

    🔄 Output version with and without text (blanked bubbles).

    🔄 Detect and isolate speech bubbles.

    🔄 Run tagger per panel.

    🔄 Support page-level and panel-level analysis.

🧪 Testing & Setup

    ✅ Virtual environment creation (Windows-compatible).

    ✅ requirements.txt for installing all dependencies.

    ✅ Instructions for proper testing of:

        Metadata extraction

        Tagging

        Dashboard features

        CLI (planned)
